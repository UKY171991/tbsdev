          was commenced in September 2001 by <a href="mailto:lucy@neamefamily.com">Lucy 

          Neame</a> in South Australia and <a href="mailto:laura@neamefamily.com">Laura 

          Neame</a> in Canada, with the valuable assistance and co-operation of 

          Michelle Desmond in New Zealand, and many others.<br /> <br />

          Very little is known of Thomas Neame who suddenly appeared in Kent circa 

          1400, and whose descendants are entered and listed in the 1959 Book 

          of Landed Gentry. The family were very well known and respected in Birchington, 

          Thanet, Canterbury, Goodnestone, Woodnesborough, and other surrounding 

          areas and townships of Kent. Today, there are descendants of this family 

          still living and farming in Kent, and the Neame's can be found as far 

          afield as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, America, India, 

          and of course Great Britain. As ALL Neame's are related, the purpose 

          of this site is to collate the history of the NEAME family via submissions 

          of family data, interesting stories and photographs, and to provide 

          a forum for exchange of information.<br /> <br />

          &quot;We are who we are today, because of all that has gone before&quot;.
